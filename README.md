# Trovert

Play it here : https://m1rr0r.itch.io/troverts

A small third person game prototype. Before you start the game, you decide whether you are an introvert or an extrovert. After the character selection, the difficulty is selected and the game begins. In order to win the game according to the character you choose, you have to escape or catch other people. All this must be done before time runs out. Since it is still under development, there may be some bugs. More complex communication paths will be created with NPCs in future updates.
