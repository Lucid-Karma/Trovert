# Trovert

A small third person game prototype. Before you start the game, you decide whether you are an introvert or an extrovert. After the character selection, the difficulty is selected and the game begins. In order to win the game according to the character you choose, you have to escape or catch other people. All this must be done before time runs out. If the selected character is introvert, you can manipulate time and own a weapon.
